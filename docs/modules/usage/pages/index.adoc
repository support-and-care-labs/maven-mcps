== Quick Start

For a typical Maven support workflow, you need:

. *mail-mcp* (local) - Access to Maven mailing list archives
. *GitHub MCP* (external) - Access to Maven GitHub repositories and issues
. *Atlassian MCP* (external, optional) - Access to Jira/Confluence if needed

See xref:ROOT:architecture.adoc[Architecture] for the deployment overview.

== MCP Components

For a complete list of available MCP components, see xref:components:index.adoc[Components Catalog].

mail-mcp::
Locally deployed MCP server providing access to Maven mailing list archives.
See xref:components:mail-mcp.adoc[Overview] or xref:mail-mcp::index.adoc[Full Documentation].

Atlassian MCP::
Provides access to Jira and Confluence.
See xref:atlassian-setup.adoc[Atlassian Setup Guide] for Apache infrastructure configuration.

GitHub MCP::
Provides access to GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests.
See xref:components:github-mcp.adoc[GitHub MCP].

== Cross-MCP Orchestration

When searching Maven-related content, references to JIRA issues, GitHub PRs, or Confluence pages can be followed across MCP servers to gather complete context.

The following instructions are used by Claude Code (via `CLAUDE.md`) and shown here for reference:
