= MCP Components
ifndef::env-site[:toc:]

== Purpose

This module documents all *MCP components* used in Maven support workflows.

Internal MCPs:: MCP servers we develop and maintain within this repository (e.g., `mail-mcp`).
External MCPs:: MCP servers developed and maintained by third parties that we _consume_ but do not develop ourselves (e.g., Atlassian MCP, GitHub MCP).

== Scope

Documentation in this module covers:

* Internal MCP servers with links to their detailed documentation
* External MCP servers relevant to Maven support work
* Comparison of alternatives for specific use cases
* Configuration guidance for integrating MCPs
* Authentication and security considerations
* Known limitations and caveats

== Structure

index.adoc:: Catalog listing all internal and external MCP components
mail-mcp.adoc:: Overview of the mail-mcp internal component
atlassian-mcps.adoc:: Detailed documentation for Atlassian MCP options
github-mcp.adoc:: Documentation for GitHub MCP (planned)

== Guidelines

=== Internal MCP Documentation

Each internal MCP has its own Antora component with detailed documentation.
The components module provides an overview and links to the full documentation.

=== External MCP Documentation

Document an external MCP when:

* It provides access to data sources relevant to Maven support
* Multiple alternatives exist and comparison would help future decisions
* Configuration or authentication requires non-obvious steps
* We have practical experience using it in our workflows

=== Documentation Standards

* Include the research date explicitly in each document
* List all discovered alternatives, not just the recommended one
* Note deployment requirements (Cloud vs. Server/Data Center)
* Document authentication methods (API tokens, PAT, OAuth)
* Keep information up-to-date; note when content may be outdated
