= Maven MCPs
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

== Overview

*Maven MCPs* is a collection of autonomous MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers designed to help with Apache Maven improvements.
Each server provides LLM-accessible tools and context that enable better understanding of, and contributions to, the Apache Maven project.

== Purpose

This collection of MCP servers aims to provide comprehensive tooling for:

* Analyzing Maven mailing list history and discussions
* Supporting Maven development and maintenance workflows
* Enabling LLM-assisted Maven improvements and contributions
* Providing contextual information about Maven's evolution

== MCP Server Projects

=== link:mail-mcp/README.adoc[mail-mcp]

MCP server for accessing and analyzing Apache Maven mailing list archives.

* Contains 700+ MB of historical mbox files from 2002-present
* Provides tools for retrieving and querying email archives
* Supports multiple Apache mailing lists

See link:mail-mcp/README.adoc[mail-mcp README] for details.

=== Future Projects

Additional MCP servers will be added to support various aspects of Maven development and maintenance.

== External MCP References

We also consume third-party MCP servers for accessing external services.
These are documented in link:docs/external/index.adoc[docs/external/].

Currently documented:

* link:docs/external/atlassian-mcps.adoc[Atlassian MCPs] - Jira and Confluence access

See link:docs/adr/0002-external-mcp-references.adoc[ADR-0002] for the rationale behind this documentation approach.

== Supporting Projects

=== link:maven-simple-reports/README.adoc[maven-simple-reports]

Supporting project for generating simple reports and statistics about Maven development.

* Not an MCP server itself, but provides useful tools and analysis
* Helps with Maven support and care workflows

See link:maven-simple-reports/README.adoc[maven-simple-reports README] for details.

== Project Structure

Each MCP server is in its own subdirectory with:

`README.adoc`:: Project overview and getting started guide
`docs/`:: Project-specific documentation in AsciiDoc format
`docs/adr/`:: Architecture Decision Records
`src/`:: Source code
`tests/`:: Test files

== Documentation

* All documentation is written in *AsciiDoc format* (`.adoc` files)
* See link:docs/adr/0001-documentation-standards.adoc[ADR-0001] for documentation standards
* Each sub-project maintains its own detailed documentation
* Project-wide ADRs are stored at the root level in `docs/adr/`
* Project-specific ADRs are in each project's `docs/adr/` directory
* External MCP documentation is in `docs/external/`

== Getting Started

Navigate to the specific MCP server directory you're interested in and read its README.adoc file.

[source,bash]
----
cd mail-mcp
----

== Contributing

When adding new MCP servers:

. Create a new subdirectory at the root level
. Follow the established project structure (README.adoc, docs/, src/, tests/)
. Document architectural decisions in ADR format in `docs/adr/`
. Update this README.adoc to list the new project

== Technology

MCP (Model Context Protocol):: Server framework for LLM tool exposure
Python 3.11+:: Primary implementation language
AsciiDoc:: Documentation format
Poetry:: Dependency management and virtual environments
