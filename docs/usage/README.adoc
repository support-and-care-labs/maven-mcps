= Usage Documentation
:toc:

== Purpose

This directory contains documentation for _using_ the Maven MCP ecosystem.

Usage docs:: How to install, configure, and use MCPs together in workflows.
External docs:: Information about third-party MCPs we consume (see link:../external/[docs/external/]).
Project docs:: Individual MCP project documentation (in each subdirectory).

== Scope

Documentation in this directory covers:

* System architecture and deployment diagrams
* Installation and configuration guides
* Integration between multiple MCPs
* Client-specific guides (Claude Code, etc.)
* Usage scenarios and workflows

== Structure

index.adoc:: Catalog and landing page for all usage documentation
architecture.adoc:: System architecture with deployment diagrams
claude-code.adoc:: Guide for using MCPs with Claude Code (planned)
diagrams/:: Visual diagrams (SVG exports and editable sources)

== Guidelines

=== When to Add Usage Documentation

Add usage documentation when:

* Describing how multiple MCPs work together
* Providing installation or configuration instructions
* Documenting client-specific integration (e.g., Claude Code)
* Illustrating architecture or deployment scenarios

=== Diagram Standards

* Use diagrams.net (draw.io) for creating diagrams
* Export as SVG for documentation display
* Store editable source files (`.drawio.svg`) for future updates
* Use UML deployment diagrams for architecture visualization
