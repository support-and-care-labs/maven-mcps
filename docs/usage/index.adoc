== Quick Start

For a typical Maven support workflow, you need:

. *mail-mcp* (local) - Access to Maven mailing list archives
. *GitHub MCP* (external) - Access to Maven GitHub repositories and issues
. *Atlassian MCP* (external, optional) - Access to Jira/Confluence if needed

See xref:architecture.adoc[Architecture] for the deployment overview.

== MCP Components

=== Internal MCPs

mail-mcp::
Locally deployed MCP server providing access to Maven mailing list archives.
See xref:../../mail-mcp/README.adoc[mail-mcp documentation].

=== External MCPs

GitHub MCP::
Provides access to GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests.
Typically pre-configured in Claude Code.

Atlassian MCP::
