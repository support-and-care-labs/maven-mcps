== Overview

This catalog lists external MCP servers that can be integrated into Maven support workflows.
These are third-party servers we consume but do not develop ourselves.

For information about MCP servers we develop, see xref:../../README.adoc[Maven MCPs Overview].

== Planned Evaluations

The following external services may be documented in the future as needs arise:

* *GitHub MCP* - Already available via `mcp__github__*` tools; may document advanced usage
* *Web Search MCPs* - Various implementations for web research capabilities
* *Database MCPs* - Access to databases relevant to Maven infrastructure

== How to Add New External MCPs

. Research available MCP implementations for the target service
. Document all alternatives with comparison matrix
. Note the research date explicitly
. Include authentication methods and deployment requirements
. Add entry to this catalog index

See xref:README.adoc[README] for detailed guidelines.
