== Overview

This catalog provides guides for using the Maven MCP ecosystem.

For information about individual MCP projects, see xref:../../README.adoc[Maven MCPs Overview].
For external MCP documentation, see xref:../external/index.adoc[External MCP Catalog].

== Quick Start

For a typical Maven support workflow, you need:

. *mail-mcp* (local) - Access to Maven mailing list archives
. *GitHub MCP* (external) - Access to Maven GitHub repositories and issues
. *Atlassian MCP* (external, optional) - Access to Jira/Confluence if needed

See xref:architecture.adoc[Architecture] for the deployment overview.

== MCP Components

=== Internal MCPs

mail-mcp::
Locally deployed MCP server providing access to Maven mailing list archives.
See xref:../../mail-mcp/README.adoc[mail-mcp documentation].

=== External MCPs

GitHub MCP::
Provides access to GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests.
Typically pre-configured in Claude Code.

Atlassian MCP::
Provides access to Jira and Confluence.
See xref:atlassian-setup.adoc[Atlassian Setup Guide] for Apache infrastructure configuration, or xref:../external/atlassian-mcps.adoc[Atlassian MCPs] for MCP options.

[[cross-mcp-orchestration]]
== Cross-MCP Orchestration

When searching Maven-related content, references to JIRA issues, GitHub PRs, or Confluence pages can be followed across MCP servers to gather complete context.

The following instructions are used by Claude Code (via `CLAUDE.md`) and shown here for reference:
