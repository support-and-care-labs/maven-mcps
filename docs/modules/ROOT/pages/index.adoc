= Maven MCPs Documentation
ifndef::env-site[:toc:]
:toclevels: 2

== Overview

This is the documentation hub for *Maven MCPs*, a collection of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers designed to help with Apache Maven improvements.

These MCP servers can be used with any MCP-compatible LLM client.
This documentation focuses on https://claude.ai/code[Claude Code] as the primary client, but the MCPs work equally well with other clients such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any tool supporting the MCP standard.

== Purpose

This collection of MCP servers provides comprehensive tooling for:

* Analyzing Maven mailing list history and discussions
* Supporting Maven development and maintenance workflows
* Enabling LLM-assisted Maven improvements and contributions
* Providing contextual information about Maven's evolution

== Available MCP Servers

xref:mail-mcp::index.adoc[Mail MCP]::
Search and analyze Apache Maven mailing list archives (dev@ and users@) from 2002 to present.

xref:components:github-mcp.adoc[GitHub MCP]::
Access Maven GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests.

xref:components:atlassian-mcps.adoc[Atlassian MCP]::
Access Apache Jira (legacy issues) and Confluence (wiki documentation).

See xref:usage:mcp-setup.adoc[MCP Setup] for installation instructions.

== Getting Started

For guidance on setting up and using the complete MCP ecosystem:

* xref:prerequisites.adoc[Prerequisites] - what you need to install
* xref:architecture.adoc[System Architecture] - deployment diagram and component overview
* xref:usage:index.adoc[Usage Documentation] - guides for using MCPs together

See xref:development:adr/0003-usage-documentation.adoc[ADR-0003] for the documentation approach.

== Project Structure

Each MCP server is in its own subdirectory with:

`README.adoc`:: Project overview and quick start
`docs/`:: Antora documentation component
`docs/modules/<name>/pages/`:: Documentation pages
`docs/modules/<name>/partials/`:: Reusable content fragments
`src/`:: Source code
`tests/`:: Test files

NOTE: Documentation uses https://antora.org[Antora] for multi-component site generation.
Each `docs/` directory is an Antora component with a `modules/` subdirectory.

Other languages are possible depending on MCP requirements.
AsciiDoc with Antora:: Documentation format and site generator

== Contributing

When adding new MCP servers:

. Create a new subdirectory at the root level
. Follow the established project structure
. Set up an Antora documentation component in `docs/`
. Document architectural decisions in ADR format
. Update this index to list the new project
