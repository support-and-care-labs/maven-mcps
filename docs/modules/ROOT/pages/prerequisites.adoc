== Overview

This page lists the prerequisites for *using* the Maven MCP ecosystem.
For development prerequisites, see xref:development:prerequisites.adoc[Development Prerequisites].

[NOTE]
====
*About "Docker" terminology*

Throughout this documentation, "Docker" refers to any OCI-compatible container runtime.
You can use Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, Podman, containerd, or any other compatible runtime.
Commands shown use `docker` syntax, but substitute your runtime's equivalent commands as needed.

[[nodejs]]
== Node.js

Node.js provides `npm` and `npx`, required for installing and running several components.

Used by::
* *Claude Code*: Installation via `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
* *GitHub MCP*: Runs via `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`

Installation::
* https://nodejs.org/[Node.js Official] - Download LTS version
* Via package manager:
+
[source,bash]
----
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install node

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install nodejs npm

# Windows (Chocolatey)
choco install nodejs-lts
----

Verification::
[source,bash]
----
node --version
npm --version
npx --version
----

TIP: Node.js 18+ is recommended for best compatibility.

[[container-runtime]]
== Container Runtime

A container runtime is required for running the MCP servers and their dependencies.

Used by::
* *mail-mcp*: Runs Elasticsearch for indexing and searching email archives, and the MCP server itself
* *Atlassian MCP*: Runs the mcp-atlassian container

Options::
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker Engine] (Linux)
* https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop] (macOS, Windows, Linux)
* https://podman.io/[Podman] (Linux, macOS, Windows)

Verification::
[source,bash]
----
docker --version
# or: podman --version
----

For Compose support:
[source,bash]
----
docker compose version
# or: podman-compose --version
----

[[apache-pat]]
== Personal Access Tokens (Apache Infrastructure)

Personal Access Tokens (PAT) are required for accessing Apache's self-hosted Atlassian instances.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Apache runs *Atlassian Server/Data Center* (not Cloud).
PAT authentication is the only supported method for these self-hosted instances.
====

Used by::
* *Atlassian MCP*: Access to Apache Jira and Apache Confluence

Required tokens::
* *Confluence PAT*: For accessing https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/[Apache Confluence]
* *Jira PAT*: For accessing https://issues.apache.org/jira[Apache Jira]

Setup::
You need an Apache account with access to these services.
See xref:usage:atlassian-mcp-setup.adoc#_generating_personal_access_tokens[Generating Personal Access Tokens] for step-by-step instructions.

[[github]]
== GitHub Account

A GitHub account is required for the GitHub MCP.

Used by::
* *GitHub MCP*: Access to repositories, issues, and pull requests

Setup::
. Create an account at https://github.com[GitHub] (if you don't have one)
. Authenticate via GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`
+
Or generate a Personal Access Token at https://github.com/settings/tokens[GitHub Settings > Tokens]

[NOTE]
====
GitHub MCP is typically pre-configured in Claude Code installations.
