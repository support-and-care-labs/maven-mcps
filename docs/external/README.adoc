= External MCP Servers
:toc:

== Purpose

This directory documents *external MCP servers* that can be integrated into our Maven support workflows.

External MCPs:: MCP servers developed and maintained by third parties that we _consume_ but do not develop ourselves.
Internal MCPs:: MCP servers we develop and maintain within this repository (e.g., `mail-mcp`).

== Scope

Documentation in this directory covers:

* Available external MCP servers relevant to Maven support work
* Comparison of alternatives for specific use cases
* Configuration guidance for integrating external MCPs
* Authentication and security considerations
* Known limitations and caveats

== Structure

index.adoc:: Catalog and landing page listing all documented external MCPs
<service>-mcps.adoc:: Detailed documentation for each external service category

== Guidelines

=== When to Document an External MCP

Document an external MCP when:

* It provides access to data sources relevant to Maven support
* Multiple alternatives exist and comparison would help future decisions
* Configuration or authentication requires non-obvious steps
* We have practical experience using it in our workflows

=== Documentation Standards

* Include the research date explicitly in each document
* List all discovered alternatives, not just the recommended one
* Note deployment requirements (Cloud vs. Server/Data Center)
* Document authentication methods (API tokens, PAT, OAuth)
* Keep information up-to-date; note when content may be outdated
